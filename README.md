## About

Statica is a module for [Piranha CMS](https://www.github.com/piranhacms/piranha.core) that turns
a **recursive** structure of `Markdown` files into a page structure that can be accessed from your
**Piranha website**. The module can for example be used to display documentation on your website that
you want to author and edit somewhere else than through your website.

For example the module will be used on the official [Piranha website](http://www.piranhacms.org) to
render the documentation section.
